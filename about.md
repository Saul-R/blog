# I *believe* in what I do and I *enjoy* it.

## My day-to-day goals

 #### 1. Make my team faster and the infrastructure more reliable.

Things I make are meant to be **SIMPLE** and reproducible. This is usually my first step to achieve reliability. Any change in the infrastructure or the design should take 5 mins to explain to a colleague (and yes, project managers are also colleagues).
 
 #### 2. Make business goals my goals.

I believe we should be result oriented. New technology? fun I guess. Getting MEANINGFUL outcomes in the projects? Things just got real. 
I'm not an advocate of anything until I hear what the problem is. People over Process over Tools.

 #### 3. Be open. Be mindful. Be communicative.

Team, team, team (much like [Denholm Reynholm from the IT crowd](https://youtu.be/pGFGD5pj03M?t=57)). Communication and collaboration should be the standard on a healthy team. I believe code review, because code is meant to be shared and reviewed (minding there is a human behind all that). It makes people improve, make everyone more collaborative and keeps people on the loop.

# Things I like to do when I'm not working. 


I love hiking, and I am a country bumpkin. I love my [hometown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanabria_(comarca)), but I've made sure to travel enough to appreciate every culture and don't judge ‚ù§.

I'm a board game enthusiast, huge fan of Amerithrash games (coop preferably).

I like mechanical keyboards clickityclacketing (like the Leopold FC660M I'm writing on right now). No blue switches though, I know how murder-inducing are those (wink wink).

I play 5 string banjo, the guitar and a couple of other weird instruments consisting on strings and/or metallic pieces.

I can listen to almost everything from Brutal Death Metal to Country Folk passing through Jazz Manouche, Delta Blues, Dark Synthwave or Mongolian Throat Singing. [No jokes](https://www.last.fm/es/user/estifjarris/listening-report/year)

Also I love Batman 1966. Run see that now.
