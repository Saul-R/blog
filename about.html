<h2 id="my-day-to-day-goals:">My day-to-day goals</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3> 1. Make my team faster and the infrastructure more reliable.</h3>
<p>Things I make are meant to be <strong>SIMPLE</strong> and reproducible. This is usually my first step to achieve reliability. Any change in the infrastructure or the design should take 5 mins to explain to a colleague (and yes, project managers are also colleagues).</p>
<h3> 2. Make business goals my goals.</h3>
<p>I believe we should be result oriented. New technology? fun I guess. Getting MEANINGFUL outcomes in the projects? Things just got real. I’m not an advocate of anything until I hear what the problem is. People over Process over Tools.</p>
<h3> 3. Be open. Be mindful. Be communicative.</h3>
<p>Team, team, team (much like <a href="https://youtu.be/pGFGD5pj03M?t=57">Denholm Reynholm from the IT crowd</a>). Communication and collaboration should be the standard on a healthy team. I believe code review, because code is meant to be shared and reviewed (minding there is a human behind all that). It makes people improve, make everyone more collaborative and keeps people on the loop.</p>

<h1 id="things-i-like-to-do-when-im-not-working.">Things I like to do when I’m not working.</h1>
<p>I love hiking, and I am a country bumpkin. I love my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanabria_(comarca)">hometown</a>, but I’ve made sure to travel enough to appreciate every culture and don’t judge ❤.</p>
<p>I’m a board game enthusiast, huge fan of Amerithrash games (coop preferably).</p>
<p>I like mechanical keyboards clickityclacketing (like the Leopold FC660M I’m writing on right now). No blue switches though, I know how murder-inducing are those (wink wink).</p>
<p>I play 5 string banjo, the guitar and a couple of other weird instruments consisting on strings and/or metallic pieces.</p>
<p>I can listen to almost everything from Brutal Death Metal to Country Folk passing through Jazz Manouche, Delta Blues, Dark Synthwave or Mongolian Throat Singing. <a href="https://www.last.fm/es/user/estifjarris/listening-report/year">No jokes</a></p>
<p>Also I love Batman 1966. Run see that now.</p>
