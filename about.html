<h2 id="my-day-to-day-goals:">My daily goals:</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3> #1. Make my team faster and the infrastructure more reliable.</h3>
<p>Things I make are meant to be <strong>SIMPLE</strong> and reproducible. This is usually a good first step to achieve reliability. I'm always able to quickly explain any change in the infrastructure, the code or the design to my colleagues (and yes, project managers are also colleagues).</p>
<h3> #2. Make business goals my goals.</h3>
<p>I am results oriented. New technology? fun I guess. Getting MEANINGFUL outcomes in the projects? Things just got real. I’m not an advocate of anything until I hear what the problem is. People over Process over Tools.</p>
<h3> #3. Be open. Be mindful. Be communicative.</h3>
<p>Team, team, team (much like <a href="https://youtu.be/pGFGD5pj03M?t=57">Denholm Reynholm from the IT crowd</a>). Communication and collaboration should be the standard on a healthy team. Among other things, I believe in being open to everyone on a team. Code reviews, constant feedback & getting involved.</p>

<p> I'm an expert on all things Linux. I've worked on AI projects more than 5 years as Ops/Engineering. I'm experienced on microservice architectures and Hadoop all the way from design to development to production. </p>
<p>I've never been in a project that didn't make it to prod.</p>
<p>I'm an AWS expert and I have a MSc in Machine Learning.</p>

<h1 id="things-i-like-to-do-when-im-not-working.">Things I like to do when I’m not working.</h1>
<p>I love hiking, and I am a country bumpkin. I love my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanabria_(comarca)">hometown</a>, but I’ve traveled enough to appreciate every culture and keep an open mind ❤.</p>
<p>I’m a board game enthusiast, huge fan of Amerithrash games (coop preferably).</p>
<p>I like mechanical keyboards clickityclacketing (like the Leopold FC660M I’m writing on right now). No blue switches though, I know how murder-inducing are those (wink wink).</p>
<p>I play 5 string banjo, the guitar and a couple of other weird instruments consisting on strings and/or metallic pieces.</p>
<p>I can listen to almost everything from Brutal Death Metal to Country Folk passing through Jazz Manouche, Delta Blues, Dark Synthwave or Mongolian Throat Singing. <a href="https://www.last.fm/es/user/estifjarris/listening-report/year">No jokes</a></p>
<p>Also I love Batman 1966. Run see that now.</p>
